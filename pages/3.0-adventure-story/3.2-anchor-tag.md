# The Anchor Tag
An anchor tag is an HTML element used to create a link to another page or
resource. It almost always has an `href` attribute, which specifies the URL of
the page or resource you want to link to.

For example, the following anchor tag will link to the Google homepage:
```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
```

# Open Pages in New Tabs 
An anchor tag also has a `target` attribute which can be used to redirect where
the linked page should open. The most common target attributes are `_blank`
(opens the page in a new tab) and `_self` (opens the page in the same tab).

For example, the following anchor tag will link to the Google homepage and open it in a new tab:
```html
<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>
```

# Creating a Web Site
A web page is a single page of content, while a web site is a collection of web
pages that are linked together. Anchor tags can be used to provide navigation
between different pages on a website. 

For example, let's say you want to create a website with the following pages:

- About Me (about.html)
- Portfolio (portfolio.html)
- Contact Information (contact.html)

A very simple version might look like this:

<iframe 
    src="https://example-portfolio.jcbbjjttt.repl.co/about.html"
    style="width: 600px; height: 400px; border: 1px solid black;"
    scrolling="no"
    ></iframe>

The source code for each page is below:

## About Me (about.html)

```html
<h1>About Me</h1>
<a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a><br/>
<a href="contact.html">Contact Information</a>
