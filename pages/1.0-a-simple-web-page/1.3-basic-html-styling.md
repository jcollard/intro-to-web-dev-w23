# 1.3 Basic HTML Styling

# Styling HTML Elements With the Style Attribute

Using the `style` attribute, you can easily style HTML elements such as
paragraphs, headers, images and div tags. In this tutorial, we'll go over how to
do this. 

## Styling Paragraphs

You can use the `style` attribute to style paragraphs in HTML. For example, to
set a paragraph's font size to 14 pixels and font color to blue you can use the
following code:

```
<p style="font-size:14px; color:blue;">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

The above code will produce the following output:

<p style="font-size:14px; color:blue;">This is a paragraph.</p>

## Styling Headers

Headers can also be easily styled using the `style` attribute. For example, to
set a header's font size to 24 pixels, font weight to bold and font color to red
you can use the following code:

```
<h1 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold; color:red;">This is a header.</h1>
```

The above code will produce the following output:

<h1 style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold; color:red;">This is a header.</h1>

## Styling Images

You can also use the `style` attribute to style images in HTML. For example, to
set an image's width to 300 pixels and height to 200 pixels you can use the
following code:

```
<img src="image.jpg" style="width:256px; height:256px;">
```

The above code will produce the following output:

<img src="../../imgs/1.3-basic-html-styling/headshot.png" style="width:256px; height:256px;">

## Commonly Used Style Attributes

The web is full of styling tools, but there are certain attributes that are used
more commonly than others. Here are some of the most commonly used style
attributes:

* `font-family`: This attribute is used to set the font type of an element.
* `font-size`: This attribute is used to set the size of the font used in an element.
* `background-color`: This attribute is used to set the background color of an element.
* `color`: This attribute is used to set the color of the text in an element.
* `width` and `height`: These attributes are used to set the width and height of an element.
* `padding` and `margin`: These attributes are used to set the padding and margin around an element.
* `border`: This attribute is used to set the border around an element.
# Challenge: Create a Biography Web Page

Create a biography about yourself, your favorite fictional character, or a
famous person who is no longer living using HTML. You may use your current
Replit project or you can make a new one.

## Requirements

- Include at least 5 sections
  - Each section should have at least 5 sentences
- Use header tags, paragraph tags, and at least one image
- Use the style attribute to style each section

## Section Ideas

- Introduction
- Early Life
- Achievements
- Legacy
- Fun Facts

## Example

Below is an example of a biography written in HTML about George Washington. You
can find the Replit of it here:

# What's Next

Congratulations! You've learned the basics of creating and styling pure HTML web
pages. In the next chapter, [1.4. Sharing Your Project with the World], you will
learn how to publish your web page and share it with anyone in the world!

Then, in Chapter 2, you will learn how to use about Cascading Style Sheets that
allow you to create styling classifications that can be attached to multiple
HTML elements without the need to repeatedly use `style` attributes.
