# Class Name - Year
{: .no_toc }

Welcome to Class Name! My name is Joe Collard and I am so excited to be your
instructor this **Fall/Winter/Spring**!   This website will be your landing page
for instructions for the majority of the activities you will complete throughout
the course. One of the largest benefits of this site is the ability to use the
**Search** feature located at the top of each page which searches the entirety
of this site.

## Classroom Expectations

* Class will begin promptly at XXX. If you are going to be late, you should
  message me prior to class.
* During class, you should have your camera on at all times. If you leave your
  computer, you should leave your camera on so I know that you are not currently
  hearing me. (If you need to step away, that is fine just let me know in the chat).
* Be respectful of your peers by keeping your microphone muted when you're not
  speaking.
* If someone else is currently speaking, be sure to use the raise hand feature
  which will add you to a raised hand queue. This ensure you will be called on
  in the order that hands were raised. You should **NOT** speak over me or
  another student. Doing so may result in being muted.
* You should **NOT** use Slack/Discord/Phones or any other messaging programs during
  class without prior permission. If you need to send a message outside of the
  classroom chat, please ask first (you can send me a private message).

## Daily Agenda

Each day there will be a class agenda that follows the following rough outline:

### 1. QotD (5 minutes)

The first 5 minutes of most classes will begin with a **Question of the Day**.
Your responses will be submitted via [Google Classroom]. There is no reason to
prepare for these questions ahead of time. In general, these are designed to get
your brain juices flowing, practice your written communication skills, and
prepare you for the class discussion. **Note**: You are expected to write 3 - 5
well thought out sentences. During this time, you should do your best to remain
quiet and allow your peers to write their answers.

### 2. Discussion (5 minutes)

After everyone has responded to the **QotD**, there will be a brief class
discussion where you are encouraged to share your response as well as discuss
the responses of others. Although you do not need to share every class during
this time, you are expected to participate throughout the year. That said, I may
call on you so be prepared to share your thoughts.

### 3. Ask Me Anything (5 minutes)

During this time, I will answer any questions that were asked since the previous
class as well as accept additional questions. You should feel free to **Ask Me
Anything**! Want to know what I ate for breakfast? Go for it! Want to know which
Dungeons and Dragons class is my favorite? Ask away!

### 4. Activity (40 minutes)

This is where the majority of your time will be spent during this class. I am a
true believer that the best way to learn is by **doing**. During this time, you
will typically be working directly on an activity. Though, on occasion I may
have a demo or code along where we discuss an activity as a class.

In most cases, I will open break out rooms during this time and you may work on
these activities by yourself or in a group of at most 3 students. However, there
may be activities for which group work is not allowed **OR** group work is
required. For activities where group work is required, groups will be assigned
randomly.

{: .tip } 
> If you are having trouble or get stuck during an activity, you are encouraged
> to push yourself to find an answer without **immediately** asking a question. 
> 
> However, I am absolutely happy to answer any questions you might have. If you
> have no idea what to do or where to look, do not hesitate to ask for help.
> Additionally, if you find you are stuck for more than **5 - 10** minutes, you
> should ask for help.

### 5. Reflections (5 minutes)

During the last 5 minutes of class, all break out rooms will be closed and you
will be asked to complete a set of reflection questions for each day. You should
**NOT** disconnect from the video session until I have acknowledge receipt of
your reflection.

Additionally, during this time, you are encouraged to post questions to the
**AMA** for the following class.

## Developer Log (Homework)

Learning a skill takes daily practice! On most days, you will not be assigned
homework to complete. Instead, outside of this class you are expected to
complete **N** minutes of work per week practicing skills related to **CLASS
TOPIC**. In general, this can be **ANYTHING** related to the class.

{: .note } 
If you have not completed a class activity that is currently assigned, your time
should **first** be spent finishing that activity. Then, if you have time
remaining, you should spend that time working to further your skills.

To help track your progress throughout the term, you will maintain and keep
a **Developer Log**. Each time you work on furthering your skills related to
**CLASS TOPIC**, you should create a "Sign-on" entry. Then, when you have finished
working, you should create a "Sign-of" entry.

### Sign-on Entry

To help focus your efforts during a working session, you will create a
**Sign-on**. It should include the following information:

1. How much time do you **plan** to spend during this working session?
   * This will help you gauge the goals you set out when answer the next 
2. What do you **want** to accomplish during this session?
   * You should be as specific as possible. Vague accomplishments are hard to
     reach and often result in poor outcomes.
   * Bad goals: "Study", "Find a YouTube video", "Write code"
   * Good goals:
     * Study how to write loops and write at least 3 different loops  
     * Watch and code along to Bracky's YouTube video on if statements. (https://youtube.com/some-link)
     * Add 2 new locations to my Adventure Quest project: A dungeon cell and a hallway.
3. After completing the first 2 steps, you should write down the date and time.

{: .note }
Steps 1 and 2 do **NOT** count toward your time growing your skills.

### Sign-off Entry

After you have completed your working session, you should create a **Sign-off**.
It should include the following information:

1. Write down the date and time.
2. Calculate how much time you **actually** spent during this working session.
3. What did you **actually** accomplish?
   * It is absolutely okay if you didn't achieve what you set out in your
     **sign-on**. As you work throughout the term you will become better at time
     estimation.
   * In many cases, you may have actually done something that wasn't even in
     your **sign-on**. In these cases, record what you did being as specific as
     possible.
4. Add a reflection, you can (and should) use one or more of the following templates
    * I learned ...
    * I was confused about ...
    * Next time I will ...
    * I was able to overcome ...

## Submissions / Out of Class Communication

* All work will be submitted via [Google Classroom]. You will receive a join
  code during class.
* All asynchronous communications should happen via our [Slack] channel. If you
  don't have access, let me know immediately.
